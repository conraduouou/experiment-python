# DAY 64 of 100 DAYS OF PYTHON

## SQLAlchemy practice with Movie List

I'm tired. I feel exhausted and drained, not necessarily fatigued, just plain tired.
Maybe a little stress on <i>emotional</i> fatigue.

It's been a while since I made a README.MD file for a project, I feel nostalgic even
if it's only been 30+ days. Nonetheless, I want to express my thoughts on today's project
and probably talking for all my past projects that passed without any README. Spoiler:
it's not worth hearing, at least for me.

As I progressed in the course, I found myself slowly losing motivation and, well,
Angela says it's normal. Heck, many people find their motivation decreasing with
activities that are highly repetitive, so I figured this is a normal part of staying
in this course. I'll admit, there are times that I feel like giving up and just throwing
it all away for a month and bounce back, but my ever consistent self, pushing through
even though everything's hard and doesn't seem to be making any sense, does not budge.
I'm kind of thankful that I am.

The reason why I've written a journal entry today is because I started to
<strong>seriously</strong> consider quitting the course. It's true that I've gotten this
far only by myself, with little motivation coming from outside sources, but it doesn't mean
that everything I've done so far had sunk in just like how it did with me reading my past
programming language study sessions. Let's see now.. My noticeable change of approach ever
since Flask has come up is the <em>reduction of comments</em>. What's more is that I don't
see myself being too passionate about studying for the sake of efficiency and programming
prowess -- nowadays, it's just me worrying about finishing the damn job, which make me
work even longer hours. I don't know if it's just not clicking in my mind for all that I'm
exposed to, but I'm pretty sure that my productivity is not the same as before. Instead of
being proud of my work, I feel like there's a large part of understanding that I've missed.
I feel dissatisfied and ultimately disappointed with myself.

Especially today. I feel like I barely scratched the surface in understanding SQLAlchemy, let
alone, SQLite itself. I've known SQLite from exercises in CS50, but forgotten them due to the
infrequent usage. Can't blame me though, it's not like I'll use it that often in game
development. But I just can't shake the feeling that I <em>could've</em> done more. I know in
myself that I need to understand that in order to be fully qualified, and I also know that
compared to almost everyone else, I understand it enough to use it -- yet I can't shake off
the feeling that I'm sinking in a hole that I should clearly avoid.

Well, okay. Here goes. With a heavy sigh, I'll try and determine my weak points. This seems
like the only great way out of this slump, and also a learning experience. I know that
I'm tired and probably just need rest from all this, but the last thing I need right now
is to finish off in a bad point. If I feel really down with this, it just means that
I'm not taking to heart the promise God has for me, which is full of goodness and
triumph. This is only for today, and probably, a stepping stone God will use in my life
to make me advance to the next level.

Here are probably where I lacked..

<ul>
    <li>Not reading the documentation well, and specific. I need to learn how to do just that.</li>
    <li>Lack of comments to mark my progress and as well as my understanding.</li>
    <li>Time off of code, and time more for a little air.</li>
    <li>Unfirm concepts repeatedly used.</li>
</ul>

Everything's pulling me down emotionally, even things that should be giving me rest. I'll
probably sleep it out.
