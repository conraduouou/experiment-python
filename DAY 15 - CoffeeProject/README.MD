# DAY 15 of 100 DAYS OF PYTHON

## The Coffee Machine Dilemma

I was able to solve this project in under 2 hours, but I'm kind of not satisfied with
the result since I know for a fact that I could have done better without stressing out
a lot.

The start of my pressure was when I rushed making my flowchart, not considering what problems
the subproblems had that needed solving, so when I got to the main program, I ended up not
following the flowchart at all.

This is a lesson for this day. Although the project was relatively easy, my methods of not
keeping my mind in check and constantly being on edge pushed me far from what I expected it
would only require. This is a call for instructional approach on problems, with flowcharts
and planning never rushed to ensure success in every problem I shall encounter.
