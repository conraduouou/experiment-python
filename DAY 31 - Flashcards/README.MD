# DAY 31 of 100 DAYS OF PYTHON

## Flashcards Capstone

I managed to finish this with a little help in the end of the solution where
Angela had given the solution for us to do. I knew I was able to do it last
night but I couldn't bear the thought of me losing another day of 7 hours
of perfect sleep. That was probably why I was stressed all throughout the
morning knowing that I've ruined my time for the day.

But nevertheless, the day still lives on, and I still have many things to do.
Now that I've finished the capstone and managed to also tinker the program to
cater Japanese flash cards instead of French, I guess I feel a little satisfied
with the result knowing that I've managed to do everything Angela had required.
I'm definitely going to use this program in the future by adding in more Japanese
words and as well as improve the functionality by making it into an object-oriented
program, or maybe even improve the user interface by making it into a game-like
program?

That's going to be a project for the future, given that I'll have the time once
this all blows over. For now, I have to focus on the things I need to finish this
day, specifically cook for lunch, finish another day of Python, attend math class
(definitely can't miss math class) on Khan, and probably finish module 4 and pass
CWTS once and for all.
