# DAY 18 OF 100 DAYS OF PYTHON

## The Hirst Painting (LIKE WHAT?!?!)

Today wasn't a hard day, and I'm actually grateful for it since I really needed the rest
between the activities that I had been busy in--namely my STS PeTa and the upcoming Calculus
quiz. My brain's been busy, not to mention, the possible fever that might come due to the
side effect of the vaccine. Yes, I have been vaccinated today as well.

I didn't learn anything that's particularly new to me in terms of concepts, since turtle
and screen is actually just lua with its integration in love2D, making my visualization of
the project a really instinctive one. I didn't do any flowcharts today and just decided to
go all out without really sticking to the habit since it was easy enough to not be done
with a flowchart, but I'll make sure to always stick to this as my first ever step in
tackling a problem in the future.

What I also learned, that is also worth noting, is my shift to doing everything in main with
minimal functions to actually diving in to using functional programming. This is to build
up my object-oriented programming muscles as the style contains a lot of functions that call
each other. This is going to be a valuable skill for me to learn in the game development
space.
