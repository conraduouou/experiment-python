# DAY 24 of 100 DAYS OF PYTHON

## Mail Merge Problem

I was able to breeze through the problem because of my stock knowledge about
how stuff works with files in C and as well as a basic knowledge of memory in
action. It was a rather easy problem and I had fun using dot operators to call
functions consecutively in one line. I just admired the fact that I was able to
do that kind of stuff. I just knew that I wasn't able to do this before and to
be able to do it now, it's just sort of a flex.

But Angela had a message for today that hit me hard. I was trying to express
my code in a way that I feel good about myself, not about the thought of people
being able to read my code easily. I think it was David Knuth that Angela had
mentioned and I think I'll be looking for his books regarding on computer science
and his philosophy. I then changed my code to retain my knowledge about efficiency
and as well as readability. This is another turning point in my life where I'm
going to forget about a major aspect in my programming style-- it's time to shift
to a more user-friendly coding experience. Here's to becoming a better programmer
and developer!

Who knows, maybe the way that I changed my style today could bring a new programmer-
in-starting to love programming more and as well as indulge in a lifestyle of
serving rather than magnifying one's self in the world. After all, my dream and
passion is not about magnifying myself, but uplifting the one that really matters.
